Certainly! Let's create an agent that generates a short story and then creates an image based on that story using an image generation model. We'll call this agent "StoryVisionizer". It will use OpenAI's GPT for text generation and DALL-E for image generation.
Here's the complete code:
pythonCopyimport os
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, send_file
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import openai
import requests
from io import BytesIO
import uuid

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Set up OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

app = Flask(__name__)

class StoryVisionizerAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prompt_template = """
        You are StoryVisionizer, a creative AI storyteller. Your task is to create a short, engaging story based on the user's prompt.
        The story should be approximately 50-75 words long and have a clear beginning, middle, and end.
        After the story, provide a brief description (no more than 20 words) of a single image that captures the essence of the story.

        User Prompt: {user_prompt}

        Story and Image Description:

                size="512x512"
            )
            image_url = response['data'][0]['url']
            image_data = requests.get(image_url).content
            return BytesIO(image_data)
        except Exception as e:
            return f"An error occurred during image generation: {str(e)}"

story_visionizer = StoryVisionizerAgent()

@app.route('/question', methods=['POST'])

    if not user_query:

    with open(unique_filename, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(image_data.getvalue())

        "story": story,
        "image_url": f"/image/{unique_filename}"
    })

@app.route('/image/<filename>')
def serve_image(filename):
    return send_file(filename, mimetype="image/png")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
To use this code:

Save it as app.py.
Create a .env file in the same directory with your OpenAI API key:
CopyOPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

Install the required packages:
Copypip install flask python-dotenv openai requests

Run the application:
Copypython app.py


This will start a Flask server on port 5000. You can then send POST requests to http://localhost:5000/question with a JSON body like this:
jsonCopy{
    "query": "A cyberpunk city with flying cars"
}
The server will respond with a JSON object containing the generated story and a URL to access the generated image:
jsonCopy{
    "story": "In the neon-lit metropolis of Neo Tokyo...",
    "image_url": "/image/some-unique-id.png"
}
You can then access the image by making a GET request to the provided image_url.
To deploy this as a Python program:

Ensure you have Python installed on your deployment machine.
Copy the app.py and .env files to your deployment location.
Install the required packages as mentioned above.
Run the application using python app.py.

For production deployment:

Use a production WSGI server like Gunicorn: gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
Implement proper file management (delete image files after a certain time)
Add error handling and logging
Implement rate limiting and other security measures
Consider using a cloud storage service for storing and serving images

This agent provides an entertaining experience by generating unique, personalized short stories based on user prompts and then creating a visual representation of the story. Users can input any scenario or idea, and the AI will create a tale and illustrate it for them.
